title: Site Upgrades!
---

Because of some shady business practices at my old web hosting service, I've decided to ditch them completely.

Without going too in depth about the issues, suffice to say that their service just was not covering my needs anymore.


### Onward and upward!

I'm currently in the process of not only transitioning my site to another host, but I'm also attempting to do a total re-theme in the process.

With a little luck and some patience, I hope to have a new workflow that is 100% better than before!

Cheers!
