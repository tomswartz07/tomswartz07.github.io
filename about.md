I'm a geek at heart, and I really love doing what I do.

I'm a sucker for clean code, a well written sci-fi book, and long walks on the beach.


### More Information

I am a 2011 recipient of a Bachelor of Science Degree in Physics at the University of Scranton.
I had been involved in many aspects of my university community; you may find more information about these activities [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/extracurricular).

I have a strong interest in physical sciences as well as computer science.
I hope to take full advantage of these skills with a productive and fulfilling career.

I have effectively worked in multidisciplinary positions in the past, ranging from Warehouse Operations within a welding supply company to Head Developer on several technology-based projects.
