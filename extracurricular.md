### Technology
I am very involved with Open Source Computing, as well as Linux Development.

My Operating System of Choice is ArchLinux, not only for its ease of use, but for its compatibility with Windows and Mac systems. Recently, I began using Arch Linux on my netbook, and am very impressed with its ability to utilize the limited resources found on the device. I operate and maintain several groups of computers, each set up for specific tasks.

Currently, I maintain 4 computers, all of which are serviceable from my Android cell phone anywhere in the world.

I have also taught myself circuits, and have created several hobby applications using an Arduino board. I have some information regarding small projects that I have completed below.

I have been featured or have had adaptations of my projects featured on several prominent and respectable websites, including Lifehacker and TechCrunch.

### Programming
App Screenshot
I currently have 2 Android applications available for download on the Android Market and Amazon Appstore. Seen at right is a screenshot of the app. It is a minimalistic clock widget for Android phones. Currently, it does nothing more than tell time, but I have plans to greatly expand the functionality of the application. You can find the two versions of the application on the Android Market. If you have an Android phone, please try it out! I would love to have some feedback.

View more information regarding the Applications here.



Additionally, I have several projects using the Arduino development board to achieve diverse tasks. Below is a video of one project that I have created which interfaces with a computer to output text, while sounding a buzzer at different frequencies to create a song. The more astute among you may recognize this song as the famous "Theme for Portal".

### Social
I enjoy reading science fiction novels, particularly those by Michael Crichton and Douglas Adams. Science Fiction and Comedy films are a favorite of mine as well.

I have recently started to play the electric bass; my main influence is Indie Rock and Punk Rock.
